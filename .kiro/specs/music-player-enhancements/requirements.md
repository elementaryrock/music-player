# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature specification outlines the enhancements needed for the existing music player application. The current application includes a React-based music player with JioSaavn and Tidal API integration, but requires improvements in three key areas: fixing the search functionality, restoring Tidal API integration for lossless audio, and enhancing the user interface with modern visualizers and improved aesthetics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Search Functionality

**User Story:** As a music listener, I want to search for songs accurately and efficiently, so that I can quickly find and play the music I want to hear.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a search query THEN the system SHALL return relevant results from both JioSaavn and Tidal APIs within 3 seconds
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show song title, artist name, album art, and duration for each result
3. WHEN a user clicks on a search result THEN the system SHALL add the song to the playlist and start playing it immediately
4. WHEN the search API fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and suggest alternative actions
5. WHEN a user searches for an empty query THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message instead of making API calls
6. WHEN search results contain duplicate songs from different sources THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the source (JioSaavn/Tidal) for each result

### Requirement 2: Restore Tidal API Integration

**User Story:** As an audiophile, I want to access lossless audio from Tidal, so that I can enjoy high-quality music streaming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects Tidal as the audio source THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to the Tidal API endpoints
2. WHEN a user searches for songs on Tidal THEN the system SHALL return accurate results with proper metadata
3. WHEN a user plays a Tidal song THEN the system SHALL stream lossless audio quality when available
4. WHEN Tidal API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper fallback mechanisms and retry logic
5. WHEN a user changes audio quality settings THEN the system SHALL update the streaming URL accordingly for Tidal tracks
6. WHEN the system detects browser compatibility issues THEN it SHALL automatically select the best supported audio format

### Requirement 3: Enhanced User Interface with Visualizers

**User Story:** As a music enthusiast, I want an attractive and modern interface with audio visualizations, so that I can have an engaging visual experience while listening to music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN music is playing THEN the system SHALL display real-time audio visualizations that respond to the music
2. WHEN a user interacts with the interface THEN all UI elements SHALL have smooth animations and transitions
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL present a modern, aesthetically pleasing design with proper color schemes
4. WHEN music is playing THEN the system SHALL display animated album art or background effects
5. WHEN a user hovers over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback through animations
6. WHEN the visualizer is active THEN it SHALL not impact audio playback performance or cause lag
7. WHEN a user wants to customize the experience THEN the system SHALL provide options to toggle visualizer effects

### Requirement 4: Improved Audio Quality Management

**User Story:** As a user with varying internet speeds, I want intelligent audio quality selection, so that I can enjoy uninterrupted music playback regardless of my connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL detect browser audio format support and select optimal quality settings
2. WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt audio quality automatically to prevent buffering
3. WHEN a user manually selects audio quality THEN the system SHALL respect the choice and maintain it across sessions
4. WHEN switching between JioSaavn and Tidal THEN the system SHALL adjust available quality options appropriately
5. WHEN audio fails to load THEN the system SHALL attempt lower quality versions before showing an error

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Search Experience

**User Story:** As a music discoverer, I want advanced search capabilities with filters and suggestions, so that I can find music more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL provide real-time search suggestions
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by source (JioSaavn/Tidal), duration, and artist
3. WHEN a user performs a search THEN the system SHALL remember recent searches for quick access
4. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative spellings or similar artists
5. WHEN a user searches for an artist name THEN the system SHALL also show popular songs by that artist
